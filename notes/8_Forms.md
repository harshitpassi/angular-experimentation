# Angular and Forms

- Angular gives you a JSON representation of a form and it's related metadata, to allow you to work with it.
- Two approaches to creating forms with Angular:
    - Template Driven : Angular infers the form object from the DOM
    - Reactive : Form is created programmatically and synchronized with the DOM
